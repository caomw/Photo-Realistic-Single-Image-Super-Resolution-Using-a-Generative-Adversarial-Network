# Photo-Realistic-Single-Image-Super-Resolution-Using-a-Generative-Adversarial-Network
(https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802)

Implemented SRResNet(mse loss) v1.
Yields the same performance with paper.

SRResNet branch is implementation of SRResNet
SRGAN branch is implementation of SRGAN which is not finished

##Result(SRResNet)
scale\PSNR | me | paper
------------ | ------------- | -------------
x4 | 31.95 | 31.92

##TODO
implement SRGAN, VGG loss term
